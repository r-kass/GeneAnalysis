# GeneAnalysis
 Using gene analysis studies to structure bacterial phylotypes is an efficient way of analyzing the vastly numerous types of species that may be present in a particular environment. Comparative computational analyses allows us to see how bacteria are similar or different in terms of genomes, based on their environment. This can ultimately give insight as to why certain bacteria inhabit particular body regions, namely the dominant species of the belly button microbial community. In this experiment, the gene sequences of different navel, skin, and plant tissue bacterial species (within the same genus) were compared using a programmed code that analyzed gene sequence input. An output was generated that eventually revealed average percentage matches and maximum percentage matches between phylotypes. -.fasta files: used for comparison -*.txt: output of blast files; input for script -project2_script.py : script to parse blast output; input is txt file -RESULT_*.txt: results of python script - *.png: result of python script
